## Kotlin Server Side Example

### Branches explanations

1. mutablelist-crud (First steps on kotlin for server side)
    - The main idea was to implement a simple users "CRUD", using a mutableList in order to **FAKE** the database behavior, 
    having a base ```users/``` route with 5 different endpoints on it 
        - GET / -> get all users from the list
        - GET /{id} -> get user by id
        - POST / -> create user
        - PUT /{id} -> update user
        - DELETE /{id} -> delete user
